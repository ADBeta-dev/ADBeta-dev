@ADBeta-dev (alias: ADB, ADBeta) 

I develop and write code for personal projects ranging from arduino, C++, C, Python, sh scrips, Perl, HTML, and more.
Everything uploaded here is in hopes it will be helpful to anyone who would like to use it, however none of my code
is supplied with a warranty, and I encourage caution when using anyone elses code.

Have fun, feel free to suggest improvements or ideas.
